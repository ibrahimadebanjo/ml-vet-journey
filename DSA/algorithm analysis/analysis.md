 Q-1: Given the following code fragment, what is its Big-O running time?
 test = 0
 for i in range(n):
 for j in range(n):
 test = test + i * j
 1. O(n)
 2. O(n2) :)
 3. O(logn)
 4. O(n3)
 Q-2: Given the following code fragment what is its Big-O running time?
 test = 0
 for i in range(n):
 test = test + 1
 for j in range(n):
 test = test- 1
 1. O(n)
 2. O(n2) :)
 3. O(logn)
 4. O(n3)
 Q-3: Given the following code fragment what is its Big-O running time?
 i = n
 while i > 0:
 k = 2 + 2
 i = i // 2 
 1. O(n)
 2. O(n2)
 3. O(logn) :)
 4. O(n3)

  • Algorithm analysis is an implementation-independent way of measuring an algorithm.
 • Big-O notation allows algorithms to be classified by their dominant process with respect
 to the size of the problem
